Set choice_type to either Conversation, Quest or Continue

Conversation will give a simple choice dialog for blue (Question vs Walk Away)

Quest will use Conversation Path Chain to send that dialog to blues correspanding
	dialog responses (there can be one or two path options)

Continue also uses Conversation Path Chain but only takes one dialog path value and
	for the final dialog in this continuous path the Choice Type should say END

In all cases be sure to set the Area to the area that character exists
	Also set the GameObject Interacted With, the Identifier, Actor, And your Cue

If the dialog is the first to be encountered by Blue then CONTEXt should say 1st approach
