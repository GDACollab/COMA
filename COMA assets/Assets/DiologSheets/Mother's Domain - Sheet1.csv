2,Mother,"""I don't remember teaching you to interrupt.% My little angel, you just got home. Your absence was already such a strain on my nerves... you wouldn’t want to hurt your poor mother anymore, would you? What kind of terrible child would do that?% You’ve missed so many lessons in your absence.  Besides, you came just in time for your piano lesson. Play, my seraph!

Though, that’s quite a ridiculous thought, it’s probably too much for a girl her age.% You’re out here worried about the state of the world, I couldn’t grasp what she has to worry about. I’ll let you slip by darling, I have my own thinking to do.”",-1,Greenhouse,

16,Dolly,"“You know, I thought being a disembodied head would be a nice change of pace. It isn’t. I guess I should thank you for bringing my head back. It’s nicer to not worry about being a living kickball.”",-1,Toybox,
